Data Generators
=====================

Overview/Motivation
---------------------
An important portion of a data pipeline is to understand how data enters, is transformed and exits certain portions of the pipeline. 
To understand this correctly it is important to generate data with purpose of being descriptive in mind. Thus, the data generators have
been created to fulfill the following purposes:

1. To fill in the proposed data structures with *randomized* data.
2. To demonstrate the flow and transformation of data through the stages of the pipeline
3. To generate data that is reasonable but not necessarily completely realistic.
